# VResume

Project to build personal resume in VR environment.

When I started this project, I was new to the framework. Although the project looks nice, and contains potential 
for a fair degree of functionality, I learned a lot of things about what not to do through mistakes during this
project, so I have started over with another VR interface project. This time, I will use the shortcuts and tools 
I learned from this project.
